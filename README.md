# GRIP_TASK

This repository contains Python code that demonstrates how to use a decision tree classifier to predict the species of Iris flowers based on their measurements.

Files:
main.py: Python script containing the code to train a decision tree classifier on the Iris dataset, evaluate its performance, and make predictions.
README.md: This file, explaining the contents and usage of the repository.
Requirements:
To run the code in main.py, you need the following Python libraries installed:

matplotlib: For plotting the decision tree.
scikit-learn: For machine learning functionalities, including the decision tree classifier (DecisionTreeClassifier), dataset loading (load_iris), data splitting (train_test_split), and evaluation metrics (accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix).
You can install these libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install matplotlib scikit-learn
Usage:
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-folder>
Run the Code:

bash
Copy code
python main.py
This command will execute the main.py script, which performs the following steps:

Loads the Iris dataset using load_iris() from scikit-learn.
Splits the dataset into training and test sets using train_test_split() with a test size of 30% and a fixed random state for reproducibility.
Initializes a decision tree classifier (DecisionTreeClassifier) and trains it on the training data.
Evaluates the classifier's performance on the test set by computing accuracy, printing a classification report (classification_report), and displaying a confusion matrix (confusion_matrix).
Visualizes the trained decision tree using plot_tree() from scikit-learn and matplotlib.
Understanding Output:

Accuracy: The overall accuracy of the classifier on the test set.
Classification Report: Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class in the dataset.
Confusion Matrix: A matrix showing the counts of true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative predictions.
Sample Prediction:

The script also demonstrates how to predict the class of individual samples from the test set using the trained decision tree classifier.
Notes:
Adjustments can be made to hyperparameters of the decision tree classifier or parameters of plotting functions (plot_tree) to suit specific requirements.
Ensure all necessary libraries are installed before running the script to avoid any import errors.
Further Exploration:
For more detailed exploration:

Experiment with different hyperparameters of the decision tree classifier (max_depth, min_samples_split, etc.) to observe their impact on model performance.
Explore other machine learning algorithms available in scikit-learn for comparison.
Modify the dataset splitting ratio (test_size) or random state to see how they affect model training and evaluation.
